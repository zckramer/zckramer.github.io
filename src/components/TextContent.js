        program where I learned C#, and practiced video game development in Unity. After graduating in 2017, 
        earning a Bachelors degree of Science, I studied JavaScript, HTML and CSS in my spare time. When I was 
        met with competition in my job search, I decided to update my skills set and get training in full stack 
        development by attending We Can Code IT, in the fall of 2019. I graduated December 11th, 2019 with a
        certification in Software Development.`

        project was conceived and developed in three-day sprints over a three-week period for our final project 
        before graduating We Can Code It. We used Node.js for the API and front end DOM manipulation. See

        creates patterns you see as you progress through the game. It is an eight-point game object with a central
        point that spins in specified directions. We got together and I got to teach my teammates how to create patterns
        using the system. If you're interested in looking at the code, find it in the GitHub repository! The link is in
